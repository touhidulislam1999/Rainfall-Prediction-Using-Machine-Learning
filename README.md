## ✨ **Key Features**

1. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - Cleaning raw data for accuracy and consistency.
   - Normalizing features using various scalers.

2. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)**:
   - Visualizing weather patterns and trends using **matplotlib** and **seaborn**.
   - Identifying correlations and patterns that influence rainfall.

3. **Model Training**:
   - Building and training multiple machine learning models.
   - Optimizing hyperparameters for better performance.

4. **Dynamic Input Frame**:
   - A flexible framework that can handle input lengths from **1 day to n days** for prediction.

5. **Weather Prediction Function**:
   - Predicts if the upcoming day(s) will experience **rainfall** or **sunshine**.
   - Displays corresponding images:
     - **Rainy Day**: 🌧️
     - **Sunny Day**: ☀️

6. **Evaluation**:
   - Comprehensive performance assessment using standard metrics like accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
